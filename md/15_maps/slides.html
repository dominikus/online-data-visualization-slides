  <h3>Maps</h3>
  <p>One of the most common visualization tasks: putting stuff on a map!</p>
</section>

<section><h1>Projections</h1></section>

<section><h3>Projections</h3>
  <p>The main challenge of that: the 3D-ness of the real world.</p>
  <p><b>Projections</b> are functions to map 3D coordinate to a 2D plane.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>Projections</h3>
  <p>And: there's no right or wrong one! So we have a whole zoo of them!</p>

<section><h3>Projections</h3>
  <p>d3 has a whole spinoff library with tons of projections:</p>

</section>

<section><h3>Projections</h3>
  <p>And it's relatively easy to use them - let's try it
    with code/maps/01_maps_d3.html.</p>

<section><h3>Projections</h3>
  <p>Many d3 map examples use TopoJSON - Mike Bostock's optimized JSON format for storing geo data.</p>

<!-- MAPBOX GL -->

<section><h1>MapboxGL</h1></section>

<section><h3>MapboxGL</h3>
  <p>d3 is great for projecting things - but we probably also want to show those nice map tiles like in Google Maps et al.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>MapboxGL</h3>
  <p>Mapbox is a (commercial) way to show maps - but: very convenient to use, with a free plan.</p>

<section><h3>MapboxGL</h3>
  <p>Mapbox provides several APIs - their fastest and latest is MapboxGL, based on WebGL.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>MapboxGL</h3>
  <p>Let's build their Hello World example based on code/maps/mapbox-template.html</p>

<section><h3>MapboxGL</h3>
  <p>While the basic example works with the default access token, make sure to use your own at some point:<br/>

<!-- MAPBOX STUDIO -->

<section><h1>Mapbox Studio</h1></section>

<section><h3>Mapbox Studio</h3>
  <p>Mapbox comes with a cool web-based style editor: Mapbox Studio.</p>

<section><h3>Mapbox Studio</h3>
  <p>Use it to create your own style, then replace the default style from the example with it.</p>
